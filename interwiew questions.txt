Self Intro:
===========
Hi Myself  Naresh  working for techie horizon from last 4 years.
Basically  I am from  hyderabad and have completed my graduation in 2014.
I have been working from 4 years as DevOps engineer where I was responsible to manage
the CICD Pipelines as well as worked on monitoring alerts.
We are a team of 8 members 3 from onshore and 5 from offshore.
I am a part of offshore team where working on rotational shifts.
I make sure the environment is clean and the applications are accessible to the end users.
I have worked on various devops tools like git,jenkins,maven,docker,ansible and 
public cloud aws and physical data center.
On aws i worked on various services like
ECS
ECR
EC2
Application load balancer
ROute 53
S3 buckets
VPC
CLoud watch and cloud formation.
On physical machines our team support the patching activities where we work
along with linux team for the pre patching and post patching activities.


Project Details:
===============

Life Point U.s

Lifepoint comes under healthcare domain.

They have a very vast business in america.
lifepoint client deals in all medical sectors in the america.

they have there insurance policies which is covered by more than 50 % of population in america.

we work for that client for the deployment of the applciation,we make sure that the application is always up and running.

whenever there will be a new release in the application,we will be taking a window for deployment from client that depends upon SLA(service level agreement)
made at the time of contract.

we support there application to be hosted in tomcat severs in aws cloud.

we make sure there are no problems facing by end user to access the application.
As a devops engineer my role is to deploy the application.
whenever there will be changes in code that changes will be pushed to github by developers.
when all the code is developed then it will be merged to master branch and from github it will be triggered to jenkins,we configure webhooks in git for
automatic triggering of code to jenkins.

once code is triggered to jenkins and the commited code is verified by some test cases in jenkins.
once this is done then we will build the jenkins job so that the code will be build and the war/jar file created will be pushed to nexus artifactory repository.

once this is done then with the help of ansible play book this war/jar file will be pulled from nexus and deployed in tomcat in aws cloud servers.

we will be maintainign jenkins pipelines,and a total of around aws 20 servers (t2.medium vcpu 2 cpu credits 24 memory 4 gb).

all these servers are in autoscaling group which will be from min 20 - max 30 servers,so that whenever there will be high traffic then servers will scale up and down.

i will be working on git like pushing the code to github.
creating the branches if neccessary for developers.
reverting the code if any changes made by developers where not deployed successfull.

in jenkins managing the plugins,maintainign jenkins pipeline,maintainign jenkins job,runnign the jenkins job.

In aws :creation of ec2 instances for developers as per need,maintainign s3 buckets,ebs volumes,taking backup of volumes,snapshots of instances,vpc,cidr blocks.

have idea on cloudfont,loadbalancing,ssl and many other services in aws.
Task 2:
Interview Questions:
====================
DevOps:
=======
What is DevOps?
Devops is a methodology which help to remove the gap between development and operations team.
Implementation of devops will help us to track the bugs at initial stage and also release the applciation faster.

What are the different stages of DevOps?
Plan
Code
Build
Test
Release
Operate
monitor and 
Feedback.

What are the methodologies before DevOps?
Waterfall model and agile process.

Have you worked on Agile Process?
Yes,where we have scrum master who will be assigning set of task for sprint.

What is the Sprint duration?
2 weeks.

Difference between IAAS,PAAS and SAAS?

SaaS (Software as a service) platforms involve software that is available via third-party over the Internet. 

Examples of popular SaaS providers include: 

BigCommerce.
Google Workspace, Salesforce.
Dropbox.
MailChimp.
ZenDesk.
DocuSign.
Slack.
Hubspot.

PaaS (Platform as a service) focuses primarily on hardware and software tools available over the internet. 

Examples of popular PaaS providers include: 

AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
Heroku.
Windows Azure (mainly used as PaaS).
Force.com.
Google App Engine.
OpenShift.
Apache Stratos.
Adobe Magento Commerce Cloud.

IaaS(Infrastructre as a service) works primarily with cloud-based and pay-as-you-go services such as storage, networking and virtualization.

Examples of popular IaaS providers include: 

AWS EC2.
Rackspace.
Google Compute Engine (GCE).
Digital Ocean.
Microsoft Azure.
Magento 1 Enterprise Edition.

Linux:
=====
Tell 10 linux commands?
Netstat -na -- To check the running port numbers
Ps -ef -- TO check the running services
find / -name filename -- find a file
grep keyword filename -- Find a keyword from a file
mkdir -- to create the direcotry
top -- cpu utilization
sed -- to replace a text from file at run time
kill -9 -- to kill the process
touch filename -- to create zero byte size file
tar -xvf filename.tar -- TO bundle a directory

Command to check for the running ports?
netstat -na | grep port_number

Command to check the processes running?
ps -ef

Command to replace a word from file?
sed -i 's/old-text/new-text/g' input.txt

Examples for SED and AWK commands?
awk example : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/awk-command-unixlinux-examples/
Sed Example : https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-to-use-sed-to-find-and-replace-text-in-files-in-linux-unix-shell/

What is swap memory?
When the actual memory of RAM is full then swap memory is used to process the request.

Command to kill a process?
kill -9 PID

process to free disk space?
When we see memory alert then follow the below steps:
1)Login to the ec2 using ssh
2) df -h -- shows the filesystems memory and check which filesystem is occupied with space example /var
3) cd /var -- Change to var directory
4) du -sk  -- TO check the each directory size in var
5) Delete the directory / clear the sapce which has consumed more space.  

What is Inode?
An inode is an index node. It serves as a unique identifier for a specific piece of metadata on a given filesystem. 
Each piece of metadata describes what we think of as a file.

We have disk space available but still unable to create a file,what might be the reason?
Basically an inode is used for each file on the filesystem. 
So running out of inodes generally means we are unable to create file even if we have filesystem.

Command to find a file and delete the file using the same command?
find / -name "FILE-TO-FIND" -exec rm -rf {} \;

Bash Scripting:
==============
#! in bash scripting means = Shebang

Difference between bash and shell script?
Shell scripting is a method to automate tasks as a collection of commands.
Shell script can be execute on any shell.
Example of shell scripting:
#!/bin/sh
myString="GeeksforGeeks"
echo "myString: $myString"

Bash: Bourne after shell.
Bash scripting is a subset of shell scripting.
Example of bash scripting:
#!/bin/bash 
myString="GeeksforGeeks"
echo "myString: $myString"

Write a bash script to check a directory in a location,and should dispaly the message if the directory is available?
#!/bin/bash
if [ -d "/path/to/dir" ] 
then
    echo "Directory /path/to/dir exists." 
else
    echo "Error: Directory /path/to/dir does not exists."
fi

Write a bash script to check if a service is running or not,if not running then script should start the service?
#!/bin/bash
service=replace_me_with_a_valid_service
if (( $(ps -ef | grep -v grep | grep $service | wc -l) > 0 ))
then
echo "$service is running!!!"
else
/etc/init.d/$service start
fi

How to know whether the previous command has been executed successfully or not?
With the help of exit status.
If exit status is 0 then it has been successfully executed.
If Exit status is 1 then it has not been successfully executed.
$? is the exit status of the most recently-executed command.

$# = Total number of command line arguments passed.

$* = It's a space separated string of all arguments. For example, if $1 is "hello" and $2 is "world", then $* is "hello world".

$@ = Stores all the arguments that were entered on the command line.

$_ = special variable

How to run bash script in the background?
Use nohup to run the script in background.
Example:
sudo nohup ./hello_world.sh

Which version of linux are you using?
We can say RHEL 7.9 or amazon linux 
Note: The versions will get changed as per time.
Task3: Mug up all Linux commands
